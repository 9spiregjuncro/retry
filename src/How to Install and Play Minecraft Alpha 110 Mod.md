## What are the differences between Minecraft Alpha 1.1.0 and the current version?
 
Minecraft Alpha 1.1.0 mod is not just a cosmetic change, but a complete overhaul of the game mechanics and features. Here are some of the major differences between Minecraft Alpha 1.1.0 and the current version:

- The world size is limited to 256x256 blocks, and there are no biomes, villages, temples, or structures.
- The terrain generation is based on the old algorithm, which creates more varied and interesting landscapes.
- The graphics are pixelated and retro, and there are no smooth lighting, shadows, or particles.
- The sounds are low-quality and distorted, and there are no ambient sounds or music.
- The crafting system is simpler and more intuitive, and there are fewer items and blocks available.
- The combat system is more challenging and realistic, and there are fewer mobs and weapons available.
- The game mode is survival only, and there are no creative mode, cheats, commands, or achievements.
- The multiplayer mode is LAN only, and there are no servers, realms, or online features.

These differences make Minecraft Alpha 1.1.0 mod a unique and nostalgic experience for fans of the game. However, they also make the game more difficult and less accessible for new players. Therefore, we recommend playing this mod only if you are familiar with the basics of Minecraft and want to challenge yourself.
